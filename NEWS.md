# fstcore 0.9.3 (in development)

R package fstcore contains the R bindings to the C++ fstlib library needed to interface with _fst_ files as well as
the LZ4 and ZSTD sources. It was developed as a package separate from the fst package to facilitate independent
updates to the fstlib, LZ4 and ZSTD libraries.
